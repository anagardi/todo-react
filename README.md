# Simple React todo App with [forana API](https://github.com/barseghyanartur/forana)

This is a simple todo app built with React, leveraging [forana](https://github.com/barseghyanartur/forana)), a straightforward REST API provided by [Artur Barseghyan](https://github.com/barseghyanartur). The primary purpose of this project is to facilitate learning by combining React with external API integration.

## Features

- Manage tasks efficiently with a user-friendly interface.
- Leverage React components for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- Practice state management and component lifecycle in a real-world application.
- Explore and implement best practices for React development.
- Seamlessly integrate with [forana API](https://github.com/barseghyanartur/forana) for enhanced functionality.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims to enhance learning in the following areas:

- **React Fundamentals:** Understanding the core concepts of React, including components, props, and state.
- **State Management:** Practicing effective state management within a React application.
- **Component Lifecycle:** Exploring the lifecycle methods and their usage.
- **Code Organization:** Implementing best practices for structuring and organizing React code.
- **API Integration with Axios:** Understanding and implementing communication with [forana API](https://github.com/barseghyanartur/forana).
